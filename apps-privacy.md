I am not interested in collecting any personal information. I believe such information is yours and yours alone. I do not store or transmit your personal details, nor do I include any advertising or analytics software that talks to third parties.

## What Information Do We Collect?
My apps do not collect any personal information. Any data you create exist solely on your device and nowhere else.

Some apps have backup features, those backups are stored on your device. In some apps you can optionally upload backups on your own Google Account. I do not have access to that data, and only you can access it / manage it.

## Questions or concerns?
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:me@alejandrobicelis.ca)
