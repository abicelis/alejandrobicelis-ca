Keep track of your credit card balance quickly and easily with your phone.

Online banking UX is just bad for the most part. GUI is often confusing and slow. Expenses can take a long time to get posted so most of the time I find it a bit useless. This app is designed to record credit card expenses using the phone camera, and it features:

- A Simple Material design.
- Add expenses manually or using your camera with text recognition!
- Add expenses using your camera.
- Track multiple Credit Cards.
