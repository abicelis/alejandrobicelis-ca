Flight tracker apps are slow, complicated, not very intuitive, bloated and add-riddled. Plane Tracker is simple, lightweight and good-looking.

Itâ€™s free, has no ads, looks great, lets you set trips with multiple flights. This app is open-source. 

Note: **This app had to be taken down from the Play Store**. The API that it uses is unfortunately no longer free to use, you can [read more about that here](https://flightaware.com/commercial/flightxml/).
