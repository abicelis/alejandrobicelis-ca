Iâ€™m a passionate software developer, specializing in building Android applications using Kotlin and Java. I've also built multiplatform (iOS & Android) applications using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/){: target="_blank"}.

Server-side, I'm using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/){: target="_blank"} and [uWSGI](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/deploying/uwsgi/){: target="_blank"}, Python web frameworks for creating and maintaining web applications. I've deployed "headless" APIs using [Ktor](https://ktor.io/){: target="_blank"}, a Kotlin framework for building asynchronous server APIs.

I also virtualize resources on platforms such as [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/){: target="_blank"}. Managing high-availability services on VMs and LXCs and, in some cases, integrating non-OS level [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){: target="_blank"} containers in them. I've managed server instances and other resources on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/){: target="_blank"} and [Oracle OCI](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/cloud/){: target="_blank"} clouds.

I also dab into web development: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){: target="_blank"} (running this site), Sass, Javascript, jQuery and others. Web deployment: Nginx, Caddy and others. I even experimented with game development at some point! Back then, Unreal Engine 3 was all the craze.

I experiment with electronics in my free time. I enjoy designing and building analog circuits, mainly for personal use. Often times needed to control low-level electronics with high-level embedded code on platforms such as Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and ESP32 variants.
